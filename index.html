        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jonathan Pak, often called JPak by my peers, and I'm a Seattle-based software engineer with nearly a decade of industry experience!</p>
        <p>
            The majority of my professional work has been as a front-end engineer in web with a focus on React, Redux, and JavaScript for over 7 years and
            a couple of years working full-stack using Node, Express, and MongoDB. I've had experience in both a large company and at start-ups alike and
            enjoy the different aspects in both environments!
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been an avid team sports person growing up and love to work collaboratively. I'm a firm believer in "teamwork makes the dream work" and
            that the whole must be greater than the sum of its parts! One of the benef I particularly enjoy a mentorship culture and helping amplify
            others. I do pride myself on being an engineer that strives to understand the product and being empathic with the customer, so you'll see
            me jump at the opportunity to work with different stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I like to spend time with my wife and son, hike, snowboard, read, cook, and play table tennis competitively. I competed in
            table tennis collegiately and I'm in the top 25 for active men's players in the state of Washington. I try to travel a few times a year for
            tournaments!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm open for full-time work so feel free to contact me!
        </p>
